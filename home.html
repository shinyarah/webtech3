                <h1>In Christ Alone</h1>
                <p>In Christ alone my hope is found <br>
                 He is my light, my strength, my song <br>
                 This cornerstone, this solid ground <br>
                Firm through the fiercest drought and storm <br>
                What heights of love, what depths of peace <br>
                When fears are stilled, when striving cease <br>
                My comforter, my All in All <br>
                Here in the love of Christ I stand <br>
                </p>
